# gpt-clipper

Simple Python script for opening a new ChatGPT tab and pasting the code selection with Markdown blockquote formatting.

Created out of frustration upon realizing that Copilot and GPT-Plus are two separate subscriptions.

Does not do much as of now; my intention was to use a hotkey, but I am having trouble. Currently uses pyautogui; working to replace with pynput.

Simply download and run:

> python3 <path>/test.py
